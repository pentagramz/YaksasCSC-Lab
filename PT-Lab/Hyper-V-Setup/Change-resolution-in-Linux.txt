sudo nano /etc/default/grub

Change this line:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"

To this.

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash video=hyperv_fb:1920x1080"

Then in a console type:

sudo update-grub

Unfortunately, this is the highest resolution you can use for Linux Hyper-V guests.

Other virtualization solutions have guest additions which allow for higher resolutions like VMware and VirtualBox.

Note: If you have added the RemoteFX 3D Video Adapter in your VM settings you may have to remove it in order for this change to work.
