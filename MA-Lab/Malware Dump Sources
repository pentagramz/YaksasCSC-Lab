There's a number of interesting resources you can get malware from

    The premier Malware sample dump Contagio
    KernelMode.info (Focuses on Win32 and novel rootkit techniques)
    DamageLab.org (People occassionally will post their unpacked executables here, which differ from 'in the wild' executables they are seeking to drop on victim's computers, but interesting none the less, many many rips of more well known techniques and software ranging from TDL to Zeus can be found at sites like this)
    The multitude of malware dump sites such as MalwareBlacklist
    As qbi kindly pointed out, Malware.lu (You have to register for the samples)
